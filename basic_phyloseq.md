Basic manipulations of phyloseq objects. Rarefying sample species tables (or sample approximate sequence variant/operational taxonomic unit tables),
subsetting sample data (by time or data type), calculating distance metrics, phylogenetic analyses, ordinations. Does not include the creation of phyloseq
object or incorporation of meta-data (see https://github.com/TonyMane/caddis/blob/main/tutorial_dada2_to_phyloseq.md). For background on phyloseq  see
